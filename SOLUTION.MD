# RecipeShare Solution Overview

## **Architecture Overview**
RecipeShare follows a **modular, layered architecture**:
1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**: Consumes REST API endpoints, handles user interaction, and displays recipes. Uses components, state management, and custom CSS styling.
2. **Backend (ASP.NET Core)**: Implements Controllers, DTOs, and Entity Framework Core DbContext. Exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
3. **Database Layer**: Uses In-Memory EF Core database for prototyping. Can be replaced with SQL Server or cloud storage for production.

### **Data Flow**

## **Trade-offs & Design Decisions**
- **In-Memory DB**: Fast and easy for prototyping, but resets on restart.  
- **REST API**: Simple and stateless; could be extended to GraphQL for more flexibility.  
- **Frontend framework (React + Vite)**: Fast dev and hot reload; trade-off is initial learning curve.  
- **Seeding data**: Ensures demo-ready content but not persistent.

## **Security & Monitoring Notes**
- Currently, no authentication; future improvements could include JWT tokens.  
- CORS enabled for local frontend; for production, should restrict origins.  
- Logging can be added via ASP.NET Core `ILogger`.  
- Performance can be monitored via Benchmark endpoint or network analysis.

## **Cost Strategies**
- Using in-memory DB and local hosting keeps costs minimal during development.  
- For cloud deployment:  
  - Use Azure SQL Database for persistent storage.  
  - Host backend on Azure App Service or similar PaaS.  
  - Frontend can be deployed on Netlify, Vercel, or Azure Static Web Apps.  
- Optimize API calls to reduce server load and cloud costs.

## **Future Enhancements**
- User authentication and authorization
- Recipe image uploads
- Persistent cloud database
- CI/CD integration
